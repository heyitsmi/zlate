# Privacy Policy for Zlate

**Last Updated: December 18, 2024**

## Introduction

Zlate ("we", "our", or "the extension") is a browser extension that provides AI-powered text translation. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our extension.

## Information We Collect

### Information Stored Locally

The following information is stored **only in your browser's local storage** and is never transmitted to our servers:

- **API Keys**: Your AI provider API keys (Gemini, OpenAI, DeepSeek, Claude, Groq)
- **Settings**: Your language preferences, selected AI engine, theme preference, and translation tone
- **Translation History**: Your recent translations (stored locally for Free users)
- **License Key**: If you have a Premium license, your license key is stored locally

### Information Transmitted to Third Parties

When you perform a translation, the following is sent **directly to your chosen AI provider**:

- The text you selected for translation
- Your source and target language preferences
- Your translation tone preference

We do **not** act as an intermediary. Your text goes directly from your browser to the AI provider's API.

### Premium Users Only

If you have a Premium license, the following may be transmitted to our license server:

- **License Key**: For validation purposes
- **Translation History**: For cloud sync feature (optional)
- **Email**: Associated with your license (provided during purchase)

## Information We Do NOT Collect

- We do **not** collect your browsing history
- We do **not** track which websites you visit
- We do **not** collect personal identification information (unless you purchase Premium)
- We do **not** sell any data to third parties
- We do **not** use analytics or tracking scripts

## Data Storage

### Local Storage
All Free user data is stored locally in your browser using the browser's built-in storage API. This data remains on your device and is not accessible to us.

### Cloud Storage (Premium Only)
Premium users who opt to use cloud sync will have their translation history stored on our secure servers (Supabase) associated with their license key. This data is:
- Encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
- Stored securely with row-level security
- Only accessible with your valid license key
- Deletable upon request
